Title: Determination of quark and lepton masses and mixings in the microscopic
  model
Authors: Bodo Lampe
Categories: hep-ph
Comments: Contribution to the European Physical Society Conference on High
  Energy Physics (EPS-HEP2023), 21-25 August 2023, Hamburg. Part of the
  contribution recapitulates results of my earlier original work
Journal-ref: Proceedings of The European Physical Society Conference on High
  Energy Physics, PoS(EPS-HEP2023), 449 (2024) 373
DOI: 10.22323/1.449.0373
\\
  Recently, formulas for the mixing matrices of quarks and leptons have been
put forward. My contribution here describes the relevant foundational and
technical aspects which have led to those results. The work has been carried
out in the framework of the microscopic model. The most general ansatz for the
interactions among tetrons leads to a Hamiltonian H involving
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), Heisenberg and torsional isospin forces.
Diagonalization of the Hamiltonian provides for 24 eigenvalues which are
identified as the quark and lepton masses. While the masses of the third and
second family arise from DM and Heisenberg type of isospin interactions, light
family masses are related to torsional interactions among tetrons. Neutrino
masses turn out to be special in that they are given in terms of tiny isospin
non-conserving DM, Heisenberg and torsional couplings. The approach not only
leads to masses, but also allows to calculate the quark and lepton eigenstates,
an issue, which is important for the determination of the CKM and PMNS mixing
matrices. The almost exact isospin conservation of the system dictates the form
of the lepton states and makes them independent of all the couplings in H. Much
in contrast, there is a strong dependence of the quark states on the coupling
strengths, and a promising hierarchy between the quark family mixings shows up.

  We include uncertainties due to missing higher order corrections to QCD
computations (MHOU) used in the determination of parton distributions (PDFs) in
the recent NNPDF4.0 set of PDFs. We use our previously published methodology,
based on the treatment of MHOUs and their full correlations through a theory
covariance matrix determined by scale variation, now fully incorporated in the
new NNPDF theory pipeline. We assess the impact of the inclusion of MHOUs on
the NNPDF4.0 central values and uncertainties, and specifically show that they
lead to improved consistency of the PDF determination with an ensuing moderate
reduction of PDF uncertainties at NNLO.

Title: Energy-momentum tensor of the dilute (3+1)D Glasma
Authors: Andreas Ipp, Markus Leuthner, David I. M\"uller, S\"oren Schlichting,

  We present a succinct formulation of the energy-momentum tensor of the Glasma
characterizing the initial color fields in relativistic heavy-ion collisions in
the Color Glass Condensate effective theory. We derive concise expressions for
the (3+1)D dynamical evolution of symmetric nuclear collisions in the weak
field approximation employing a generalized McLerran-Venugopalan model with
non-trivial longitudinal correlations. Utilizing Monte Carlo integration, we
calculate in unprecedented detail non-trivial rapidity profiles of early-time
observables at RHIC and LHC energies, including transverse energy densities and
eccentricities. For our setup with broken boost invariance, we carefully
discuss the placement of the origin of the Milne frame and interpret the
components of the energy-momentum tensor. We find longitudinal flow that
deviates from standard Bjorken flow in the (3+1)D case and provide a geometric
interpretation of this effect. Furthermore, we observe a universal shape in the
flanks of the rapidity profiles regardless of collision energy and predict that
limiting fragmentation should also hold at LHC energies.

Title: A rotation-equivariant graph neural network for learning hadronic SMEFT
  effects

Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures
\\
  We introduce a graph neural network architecture designed to extract novel
phenomena in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) context from LHC
collision data. The proposed infrared- and collinear-safe architecture is
sensitive to the angular orientation of radiation patterns in jets from
hadronic decays of highly energetic massive particles. Equivariance with
respect to rotations around the jet axis allows for extracting the information
on the angular orientation decoupled from the jet substructure. We demonstrate
the robustness of the approach and its potential for future probes of the SMEFT
at the LHC through toy studies and with realistic event simulations of the WZ
process in the semileptonic decay channel.

\\
  Current long-baseline accelerator experiments, NOvA and T2K, are making
excellent measurements of neutrino oscillations and the next generation of
experiments, DUNE and HK, will make measurements at the $\mathcal O(1\%)$ level
of precision. These measurements are a combination of the appearance channel
which is more challenging experimentally but depends on many oscillation
parameters, and the disappearance channel which is somewhat easier and allows
for precision measurements of the atmospheric mass splitting and the
atmospheric mixing angle. It is widely recognized that the matter effect plays
a key role in the appearance probability, yet the effect on the disappearance
probability is surprisingly small for these experiments. Here we investigate
both exactly how small the effect is and show that it just begins to become
relevant in the high statistics regime of DUNE.

Title: Unraveling collisional energy loss of a heavy quark in quark-gluon
  plasma
Authors: Jiazhen Peng, Kewei Yu, Shuang Li, Wei Xiong, Fei Sun and Wei Xie
Categories: hep-ph nucl-th
Comments: 16 pages, 8 figures
\\
  At leading order in QCD coupling constant, we compute the energy loss per
traveling distance of a heavy quark $dE/dz$ from elastic scattering off thermal
quarks and gluons at a temperature $T$, including the thermal perturbative
description of soft scatterings ($-t<-t^{\ast}$) and a perturbative QCD-based
calculation for hard collisions ($-t>-t^{\ast}$). Within this soft-hard
factorization model, we find that the full results of $dE/dz$ behaves a mild
sensitivity to the intermediate cutoff $t^{\ast}$, supporting the validity of
the soft-hard approach within the temperature region of interest. We re-derive
the analytic formula for $dE/dz$ in the high-energy approximation, $E_{1}\gg
m^{2}_{1}/T$, where $E_{1}$ is the injected heavy quark energy and $m_{1}$ is
its mass. It is realized that the soft logarithmic contribution, $dE/dz\propto
ln(-t^{\ast}/m^{2}_{D})$, arises from the $t$-channel scattering off thermal
partons, while the hard logarithmic term, $dE/dz\propto
ln[E_{1}T/(-t^{\ast})]$, stems from the $t$-channel scattering off thermal
partons, and the one $dE/dz\propto ln(E_{1}T/m^{2}_{1})$ comes from the $s$-
and $u$-channel scattering off gluons. The sum of these contributions cancels
the $t^{\ast}$-dependence as observed in the full result. The mass hierarchy is
observed $dE/dz(charm)>dE/dz(bottom)$. Our full results are crucial for a
better description of heavy quark transport in QCD medium, in particular at low
and moderate energy. We also calculate the energy loss by imposing the
Einstein's relationship. The related results appear to be systematically larger
than that without imposing the Einstein's relationship.

  Triggered by the observation of four top-quark production at the LHC by the
ATLAS and CMS collaboration we report on the calculation of the next-to-leading
order QCD corrections to the Standard Model process $pp \to t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$
in the $4\ell$ top-quark decay channel. We take into account higher-order QCD
effects in both the production and decays of the four top quarks. The latter
effects are treated in the narrow width approximation, which preserves
top-quark spin correlations throughout the calculation. We present results for
two selected renormalisation and factorisation scale settings and three
different PDF sets. Furthermore, we study the main theoretical uncertainties
that are associated with the neglected higher-order terms in the perturbative
expansion and with the parameterisation of the PDF sets. The results at the
integrated and differential fiducial cross-section level are shown for the LHC
Run III center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV. Our findings are
particularly relevant for precise measurements of the four top-quark fiducial
cross sections and for the modelling of top-quark decays at the LHC.

Categories: hep-ph gr-qc hep-th
Comments: 8 pages, 3 figures

  We investigate several phenomenological implications of the Weak Gravity
Conjecture (WGC). We find that the WGC implies that the SM neutrinos must be
electrically neutral, that the electric charge in the SM must be quantized, and
that the photon must be massless. In addition, we use the WGC to set lower
bounds on the electric charge of milli-charged particles (mCP), the gauge
coupling of several $U(1)$ extensions of the SM, their kinetic mixing parameter
with the SM $U(1)_{\text{EM}}$, and the axion couplings to photons and
fermions. We also set an upper bound on the lifetime of the proton.

Title: Higgs production at RHIC and the positivity of the gluon helicity
  distribution

Categories: hep-ph
Comments: 8 pages, 2 figures

  We show that the negative polarized gluon distribution $\Delta g$ found in a
recent global next-to-leading order QCD analysis of the nucleon helicity
structure is incompatible with the fundamental requirement that physical
cross-sections must not be negative. Specifically, we show that the fact that
this polarized gluon strongly violates the positivity condition $|\Delta g|\leq
g$ in terms of the unpolarized gluon distribution $g$ leads to negative
cross-sections for Higgs boson production at RHIC as a physical process,
implying that this negative $\Delta g$ is unphysical.

Title: Fixed point actions from convolutional neural networks

Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures; Proceedings of the 40th International Symposium
  on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2023)
\\
  Lattice gauge-equivariant convolutional neural networks (L-CNNs) can be used
to form arbitrarily shaped Wilson loops and can approximate any gauge-covariant
or gauge-invariant function on the lattice. Here we use L-CNNs to describe
fixed point (FP) actions which are based on renormalization group
transformations. FP actions are classically perfect, i.e., they have no lattice
artifacts on classical gauge-field configurations satisfying the equations of
motion, and therefore possess scale invariant instanton solutions. FP actions
are tree-level Symanzik-improved to all orders in the lattice spacing and can
produce physical predictions with very small lattice artifacts even on coarse
lattices. We find that L-CNNs are much more accurate at parametrizing the FP
action compared to older approaches. They may therefore provide a way to
circumvent critical slowing down and topological freezing towards the continuum
limit.

Title: Machine learning a fixed point action for SU(3) gauge theory with a
  gauge equivariant convolutional neural network
Authors: Kieran Holland, Andreas Ipp, David I. M\"uller, Urs Wenger
Categories: hep-lat cs.LG hep-ph stat.ML
Comments: 22 pages, 15 figures, 6 tables
\\
  Fixed point lattice actions are designed to have continuum classical
properties unaffected by discretization effects and reduced lattice artifacts
at the quantum level. They provide a possible way to extract continuum physics
with coarser lattices, thereby allowing to circumvent problems with critical
slowing down and topological freezing toward the continuum limit. A crucial
ingredient for practical applications is to find an accurate and compact
parametrization of a fixed point action, since many of its properties are only
implicitly defined. Here we use machine learning methods to revisit the
question of how to parametrize fixed point actions. In particular, we obtain a
fixed point action for four-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory using convolutional
neural networks with exact gauge invariance. The large operator space allows us
to find superior parametrizations compared to previous studies, a necessary
first step for future Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: A new game with Quark Matter Cards:Interactions of elementary particles
Authors: Ana Uzelac
Categories: physics.ed-ph hep-ph physics.pop-ph
Comments: 28 pages, 13 figures, Contribution to ISMD 2023
\\
  This paper introduces a card game called "Quark Matter Card Games," inspired
by the creativity of a high school student, Csaba To ro k, and developed in
collaboration with physicist Tama s Cso rgo . The game utilizes a deck of 66
cards representing elementary particles and antiparticles, offering an
entertaining way to popularize science and introduce players to particle
physics concepts. The initial edition includes games exploring topics like
baryon formation, mesons, quark colors, and more. The author proposes a new
game focusing on the four fundamental forces. Players must strategically place
cards on a central card, simulating interactions based on strong,
electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational forces. Specific rules for particle
placement, including fundamental forces, annihilation and neutrino oscillations
are elucidated. Additional rules and conditions add complexity and strategy to
the game, ensuring active engagement. The intended audience ranges from
individuals familiar with particle physics to those new to the field. The game
provides an engaging platform for learning about elementary particle
interactions, with varying levels of complexity. The paper discusses the
educational potential, offering suggestions for simplified versions.
Furthermore, all necessary concepts are briefly explained, and the physical
background of the game is provided. The paper concludes with topics for further
discussions, linking game experiences to particle physics concepts. Questions
cover gravitational interaction interpretations, differentiation between quarks
and leptons, explanations of weak and electromagnetic interactions and more.
The acknowledgment section expresses gratitude to mentors and pioneers of card
games with elementary particles for their inspiration and support.

Title: Antiproton Bounds on Dark Matter Annihilation from a Combined Analysis

\\
  Early studies of the AMS-02 antiproton ratio identified a possible excess
over the expected astrophysical background that could be fit by the
annihilation of a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP). However, recent
efforts have shown that uncertainties in cosmic-ray propagation, the antiproton
production cross-section, and correlated systematic uncertainties in the AMS-02
data, may combine to decrease or eliminate the significance of this feature. We
produce an advanced analysis using the DRAGON2 code which, for the first time,
simultaneously fits the antiproton ratio along with multiple secondary
cosmic-ray flux measurements to constrain astrophysical and nuclear
uncertainties. Compared to previous work, our analysis benefits from a
combination of: (1) recently released AMS-02 antiproton data, (2) updated
nuclear fragmentation cross-section fits, (3) a rigorous Bayesian parameter
space scan that constrains cosmic-ray propagation parameters.
  We find no statistically significant preference for a dark matter signal and
set strong constraints on WIMP annihilation to $b\bar{b}$, ruling out
annihilation at the thermal cross-section for dark matter masses below
$\sim200$~GeV. We do find a positive residual that is consistent with previous
work, and can be explained by a $\sim70$~GeV WIMP annihilating below the
thermal cross-section. However, our default analysis finds this excess to have
a local significance of only 2.8$\sigma$, which is decreased to 1.8$\sigma$
when the look-elsewhere effect is taken into account.

Title: Entanglement Entropy in Scalar Quantum Electrodynamics
Authors: Samuel Fedida, Anupam Mazumdar, Sougato Bose and Alessio Serafini
Categories: hep-th hep-ph quant-ph
Comments: 10 pages, 1 figure
\\
  We find the entanglement entropy of a subregion of the vacuum state in scalar
quantum electrodynamics, working perturbatively to the 2-loops level. Doing so
leads us to derive the Maxwell-Proca propagator in conical Euclidean space. The
area law of entanglement entropy is recovered in both the massive and massless
limits of the theory, as is expected. These results yield the renormalisation
group flow of entanglement entropy, and we find that loop contributions
suppress entanglement entropy. We highlight these results in the light of the
renormalization group flow of couplings and correlators, which are increased in
scalar quantum electrodynamics, so that the potential tension between the
increase in correlations between two points of spacetime and the decrease in
entanglement entropy between two regions of spacetime with energy is discussed.
We indeed show that the vacuum of a subregion of spacetime purifies with energy
in scalar quantum electrodynamics, which is related to the concept of
screening.

  Dilepton production provides a unique probe of the strong electromagnetic
field produced in heavy-ion collisions. To map out the behavior of its
transverse momentum broadening, we present a theoretical model based on the
equivalent photon approximation, and then we update it to make direct
comparisons with the recent experimental measurements. We find that the model
calculations can describe well, not only the average transverse momentum
squared of $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs in Au--Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$
GeV, but also the acoplanarity of $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ pairs in Pb--Pb collisions
at$\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV. Furthermore, the model predictions are also
able to reproduce the measured dependencies of the pair mass and the transverse
momentum squared.

  The Hellings and Downs correlation curve describes the correlation of the
timing residuals from pairs of pulsars as a function of their angular
separation on the sky and is a smoking-gun signature for the detection of an
isotropic stochastic background of gravitational waves. We show that it can be
easily obtained from realizing that Lorentz transformations are conformal
transformations on the celestial sphere and from the conformal properties of
the two-point correlation of the timing residuals. This result allows several
generalizations, e.g. the calculation of the three-point correlator of the time
residuals and the inclusion of additional polarization modes (vector and/or
scalar) arising in alternative theories of gravity.

in a non-trivial way among the three particles: the correlations in the output
channels $AB$, $AC$ and $BC$ are studied in detail as functions of the
scattering parameters and of the initial entanglement weight. Although derived
in a specific case, our results exhibit some general features of other similar

Comments: 30 pages, 6 figures
Report-no: UUITP-02/24

  The phenomenon of BCJ duality implies that gauge theories possess an abstract
kinematic algebra, mirroring the non-abelian Lie algebra underlying the colour
information. Although the nature of the kinematic algebra is known in certain
cases, a full understanding is missing for arbitrary non-abelian gauge
theories, such that one typically works outwards from well-known examples. In
this paper, we pursue an orthogonal approach, and argue that simpler abelian
gauge theories can be used as a testing ground for clarifying our understanding
of kinematic algebras. We first describe how classes of abelian gauge fields
are associated with well-defined subgroups of the diffeomorphism algebra. By
considering certain special subgroups, we show that one may construct
interacting theories, whose kinematic algebras are inherited from those already
appearing in a related abelian theory. Known properties of (anti-)self-dual
Yang-Mills theory arise in this way, but so do new generalisations, including
self-dual electromagnetism coupled to scalar matter. Furthermore, a recently
obtained non-abelian generalisation of the Navier-Stokes equation fits into a
similar scheme, as does Chern-Simons theory. Our results provide useful input
to further conceptual studies of kinematic algebras.

Comments: 13 pages, 6 figures

  The upcoming galactic core-collapse supernova is expected to produce a
considerable number of neutrino events within terrestrial detectors. By using
Bayesian inference techniques, we address the feasibility of distinguishing
among various neutrino flavor conversion scenarios in the supernova
environment, using such a neutrino signal. In addition to the conventional MSW,
we explore several more sophisticated flavor conversion scenarios, such as
spectral swapping, fast flavor conversions, flavor equipartition caused by
non-standard neutrino interactions, magnetically-induced flavor equilibration,
and flavor equilibrium resulting from slow flavor conversions. Our analysis
demonstrates that with a sufficiently large number of neutrino events during
the supernova accretion phase (exceeding several hundreds), there exists a good
probability of distinguishing among feasible neutrino flavor conversion
scenarios in the supernova environment.
