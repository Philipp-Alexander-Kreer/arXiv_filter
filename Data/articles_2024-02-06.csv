Part of the  contribution recapitulates results of my earlier original work ",NA," Proceedings of The European Physical Society Conference on High  Energy Physics, PoS(EPS-HEP2023), 449 (2024) 373 ", 10.22323/1.449.0373 ,"   Recently, formulas for the mixing matrices of quarks and leptons have been put forward. My contribution here describes the relevant foundational and technical aspects which have led to those results. The work has been carried out in the framework of the microscopic model. The most general ansatz for the interactions among tetrons leads to a Hamiltonian H involving Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), Heisenberg and torsional isospin forces. Diagonalization of the Hamiltonian provides for 24 eigenvalues which are identified as the quark and lepton masses. While the masses of the third and second family arise from DM and Heisenberg type of isospin interactions, light family masses are related to torsional interactions among tetrons. Neutrino masses turn out to be special in that they are given in terms of tiny isospin non-conserving DM, Heisenberg and torsional couplings. The approach not only leads to masses, but also allows to calculate the quark and lepton eigenstates, an issue, which is important for the determination of the CKM and PMNS mixing matrices. The almost exact isospin conservation of the system dictates the form of the lepton states and makes them independent of all the couplings in H. Much in contrast, there is a strong dependence of the quark states on the coupling strengths, and a promising hierarchy between the quark family mixings shows up.

Equivariance with respect to rotations around the jet axis allows for extracting the information on the angular orientation decoupled from the jet substructure.

Within this soft-hard factorization model, we find that the full results of $dE/dz$ behaves a mild sensitivity to the intermediate cutoff $t^{\ast}$, supporting the validity of the soft-hard approach within the temperature region of interest. We re-derive the analytic formula for $dE/dz$ in the high-energy approximation, $E_{1}\gg m^{2}_{1}/T$, where $E_{1}$ is the injected heavy quark energy and $m_{1}$ is its mass. It is realized that the soft logarithmic contribution, $dE/dz\propto ln(-t^{\ast}/m^{2}_{D})$, arises from the $t$-channel scattering off thermal partons, while the hard logarithmic term, $dE/dz\propto ln[E_{1}T/(-t^{\ast})]$, stems from the $t$-channel scattering off thermal partons, and the one $dE/dz\propto ln(E_{1}T/m^{2}_{1})$ comes from the $s$- and $u$-channel scattering off gluons. The sum of these contributions cancels the $t^{\ast}$-dependence as observed in the full result. The mass hierarchy is observed $dE/dz(charm)>dE/dz(bottom)$. Our full results are crucial for a better description of heavy quark transport in QCD medium, in particular at low and moderate energy. We also calculate the energy loss by imposing the Einstein's relationship. The related results appear to be systematically larger than that without imposing the Einstein's relationship.

FP actions are classically perfect, i.e., they have no lattice artifacts on classical gauge-field configurations satisfying the equations of motion, and therefore possess scale invariant instanton solutions. FP actions are tree-level Symanzik-improved to all orders in the lattice spacing and can produce physical predictions with very small lattice artifacts even on coarse lattices. We find that L-CNNs are much more accurate at parametrizing the FP action compared to older approaches.

The initial edition includes games exploring topics like baryon formation, mesons, quark colors, and more. The author proposes a new game focusing on the four fundamental forces. Players must strategically place cards on a central card, simulating interactions based on strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational forces. Specific rules for particle placement, including fundamental forces, annihilation and neutrino oscillations are elucidated. Additional rules and conditions add complexity and strategy to the game, ensuring active engagement. The intended audience ranges from individuals familiar with particle physics to those new to the field. The game provides an engaging platform for learning about elementary particle interactions, with varying levels of complexity. The paper discusses the educational potential, offering suggestions for simplified versions. Furthermore, all necessary concepts are briefly explained, and the physical background of the game is provided. The paper concludes with topics for further discussions, linking game experiences to particle physics concepts.

However, recent efforts have shown that uncertainties in cosmic-ray propagation, the antiproton production cross-section, and correlated systematic uncertainties in the AMS-02 data, may combine to decrease or eliminate the significance of this feature. We produce an advanced analysis using the DRAGON2 code which, for the first time, simultaneously fits the antiproton ratio along with multiple secondary cosmic-ray flux measurements to constrain astrophysical and nuclear uncertainties. Compared to previous work, our analysis benefits from a combination of: (1) recently released AMS-02 antiproton data, (2) updated nuclear fragmentation cross-section fits, (3) a rigorous Bayesian parameter space scan that constrains cosmic-ray propagation parameters.   We find no statistically significant preference for a dark matter signal and set strong constraints on WIMP annihilation to $b\bar{b}$, ruling out annihilation at the thermal cross-section for dark matter masses below $\sim200$~GeV. We do find a positive residual that is consistent with previous work, and can be explained by a $\sim70$~GeV WIMP annihilating below the thermal cross-section. However, our default analysis finds this excess to have a local significance of only 2.8$\sigma$, which is decreased to 1.8$\sigma$ when the look-elsewhere effect is taken into account.

The area law of entanglement entropy is recovered in both the massive and massless limits of the theory, as is expected. These results yield the renormalisation group flow of entanglement entropy, and we find that loop contributions suppress entanglement entropy. We highlight these results in the light of the renormalization group flow of couplings and correlators, which are increased in scalar quantum electrodynamics, so that the potential tension between the increase in correlations between two points of spacetime and the decrease in entanglement entropy between two regions of spacetime with energy is discussed.

In this paper, we pursue an orthogonal approach, and argue that simpler abelian gauge theories can be used as a testing ground for clarifying our understanding of kinematic algebras. We first describe how classes of abelian gauge fields are associated with well-defined subgroups of the diffeomorphism algebra. By considering certain special subgroups, we show that one may construct interacting theories, whose kinematic algebras are inherited from those already appearing in a related abelian theory. Known properties of (anti-)self-dual Yang-Mills theory arise in this way, but so do new generalisations, including self-dual electromagnetism coupled to scalar matter. Furthermore, a recently obtained non-abelian generalisation of the Navier-Stokes equation fits into a similar scheme, as does Chern-Simons theory.
