While the gravitational interactions are required to be suppressed by the Planck scale, the matter sector is allowed to interact strongly at the AdS scale. From the perspective of the dual CFT, this requires breaking large-N factorization in certain sectors of the theory. Exactly marginal multi-trace deformations are capable of achieving this while still preserving a consistent large-N limit. We probe the effect of these deformations on the bulk theory by computing the relevant four-point functions in conformal perturbation theory. We find a simple answer in terms of a finite sum of conformal blocks, indicating that the correlators display no bulk-point singularities. This implies that the matter of the bulk theory is made strongly coupled by boundary terms rather than local bulk interactions. Our results suggest that holographic CFTs that describe strongly coupled AdS matter cannot be continuously connected to conventional holographic CFTs where all correlators factorize in the large-N limit.

To this end, we study the statistical O$(N)$ vector model in $(4-\epsilon)$ dimensions with three kinds of defects: a line defect constructed by smearing an O$(N)$ vector field along one direction and Dirichlet and Neumann boundaries. A conventional approach to critical phenomena would be to perform perturbative calculations using Feynman diagrams and doing renormalization group analysis. But we here also take a different but complementary approach based on three axioms that include conformal symmetry of the theory at the criticality. We apply this axiomatic framework to the critical O$(N)$ model with a defect and reproduce the perturbative results at the leading non-trivial order in $\epsilon$, substantiating the validity of our approach. Along the way, we develop and refine the axiomatic framework to derive anomalous dimensions of the composite operators on the defect that have not been accessible in the existing literature by focusing on the analyticity of the correlation functions.

In this paper we present a linearized effective theory using a Gaussian wavepacket description of a charged relativistic particle coupled to quantum electromagnetic fields to study the interplay between single electrons and quantum fields in free space, at a scale well below the Schwinger limit. The proper values of the regulators in our effective theory are determined from the data of individual experiments, and will be time-dependent in the laboratory frame if the single electrons are accelerated. Using this new theoretical tool, we address the issues of decoherence of flying electrons in free space and the impact of Unruh effect on the electrons. Our result suggests that vacuum fluctuations may be a major source of blurring the interference pattern in electron microscopes. For a single electron accelerated in a uniform electric field, we identify the Unruh effect in the two-point correlators of the deviations from the electron's classical trajectory.

The minimal coupling of these particles to the gravitational or Maxwell field is equivalent to the classical coupling of the Kerr black hole with linearized gravity or the so-called $\sqrt{\text{Kerr}}$ charged state with the electromagnetic field. The action of the Newman-Janis symmetry on scattering amplitudes was then used to compute the linear impulse at first post-Minkowskian (1PM) order, via the Kosower, Maybee, O'Connell (KMOC) formalism. In this paper, we continue with the idea of using the Newman-Janis symmetry on the space of scalar QED amplitudes to compute classical observables such as the radiative gauge field and the angular impulse. We show that for tree-level amplitudes, the Newman-Janis symmetry action can be reinterpreted as a dressing of the photon propagator. This turns out to be an efficient way to compute these classical observables.

It is known from analytic approaches and numerical simulations that the IKKT matrix model with a mass term admits interesting cosmological solutions.

In the present paper, we show that an effective mass matrix can arise naturally in the IKKT model by imposing a toroidal compactification where the space-time fermions acquire anti-periodic boundary conditions. When six spatial dimensions are chosen to be compact, the effective mass matrix breaks the SO(1,9) space-time symmetry of the IKKT model to SO(1,3) $\times$ SO(6).

The amplitude of this second-order effect is proportional to the square of the linear mode amplitude, with the ratio being linked to the nature of the Kerr black hole. Focusing on the linear $(l=m=2,n=0)$ mode, we compute the dependency of the ratio on the dimensionless spin of the black hole, ranging up to 0.99, with the method applicable for more general mode couplings. Our calculation makes use of the frequency-domain, second-order Teukolsky equation, which involves two essential steps (a) analytically reconstructing the metric through the Chrzanowski-Cohen-Kegeles approach and (b) numerically solving the second-order Teukolsky equation using the shooting method along a complex contour. We find that the spin dependence of the ratio shows a strong correlation with the angular overlap between parent and child modes, providing qualitative insights into the origin of the dependence. Depending on the nature of the angular overlap, the ratio decreases with spin in scenarios such as the channel $(l=m=2,n=0)\times(l=m=2,n=0)\to(l=m=4)$ or increases in situations like $(l=m=2,n=0)\times(l=m=2,n=0)\to(l=5,m=4)$.

The calculated conversion rates differ from previous calculations, particularly in the region of large permanent quadrupole deformation.

Pereira , hep-ph ," PhD Thesis, 186 pages, Abstract in English and Portuguese ",NA,NA,NA,"   Non-unitary $3 \times 3$ mixing matrices are present in many extensions of the Standard Model. One of the most simple extensions is the addition of $n_R$ right-handed neutrinos without imposing Lepton Number Conservation ($n_R$$\nu$SM). In the region of the parameter space where the usual seesaw approximation is valid, deviations from $3 \times 3$ unitarity of the leptonic mixing matrix are negligible, while one has three light neutrinos and two or three heavy neutrinos with masses close to the GUT scale. This gap between the mass scales occurs while having order 1 Yukawa couplings, providing a natural explanation for the smallness of light neutrino masses - hence the name seesaw. Other regions of the parameter space, with lighter heavy neutrinos - with an eV or keV mass, for instance - and bigger deviations from unitarity of the leptonic mixing matrix, are still allowed by experiment. In fact, whenever heavy neutrino masses are many orders of magnitude below the GUT scale there are interesting phenomenological implications at low energies. To analyse such regions with precision, one needs an exact parameterisation, since approximations that were valid in the usual seesaw case now fail. This thesis will consist of a study and classification of regions of the 3$\nu$SM parameter space in the light of a newly-developed exact parameterisation. Furthermore, it will also include a study of models with vector-like quarks, another simple extension of the SM, that contains a $3 \times 3$ non-unitary quark mixing matrix. Studying the most interesting regions of the parameter space of vector-like quarks models also benefits from the use of the aforementioned exact parameterisation. These regions are phenomenologically rich and may explain certain open questions like the CKM unitarity problem/Cabibbo angle anomaly.

Rev. D ; 16 Pages, 10 figures ",NA,NA,NA,"   Considering ten well-known relativistic mean field models, we invoke feeble interaction between hadronic matter and fermionic dark matter (DM) $\chi$ via new physics scalar ($\phi$) and vector ($\xi$) mediators in neutron star core, thereby forming DM admixed neutron stars (DMANSs). The chosen masses of the DM fermion ($m_{\chi}$) and the mediators ($m_{\phi}$ and $m_{\xi}$) are consistent with the self-interaction constraint from Bullet cluster while their respective couplings ($y_{\phi}$ and $y_{\xi}$) are also constrained by the present day relic abundance. Assuming that both $\phi$ and $\xi$ contribute equally to the relic abundance, we compute the equation of state of the DMANSs and consequently their structural properties. We found that for a particular (constant) DM density, the presence of lighter DM results in more massive DMANSs with larger radius. In the light of the various recent constraints like those from the massive pulsar PSR J0740+6620, the gravitational wave (GW170817) data and the results of NICER experiments for PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, we provide a bound on $m_{\chi}$ within the framework of the present work as $m_{\chi}\approx$ (0.1 $-$ 30) GeV for a wide range of fixed DM Fermi momenta $k_F^{\chi}$=(0.01 $-$ 0.06) GeV. In the case of the hadronic models that yield larger radii corresponding to the low mass neutron stars in the no-DM scenario, interaction with comparatively heavier DM fermion is necessary in order to ensure that the DMANSs obtained with such models satisfy the radius constraints from both GW170817 and NICER data for PSR J0030+0451.

An outstanding question is how inspiraling SMBHs get past the ""final parsec"" of separation, where they have a tendency to stall before GW emission alone can make the binary coalesce. We argue that dynamical friction from the dark matter (DM) spike surrounding the black holes is sufficient to resolve this puzzle, if the DM has a self-interaction cross section of order $0.2-5\,$cm$^2$/g. The same effect leads to a softening of the GW spectrum at low frequencies as suggested by the current data. For collisionless cold DM, the friction deposits so much energy that the spike is disrupted and cannot bridge the final parsec, while for self-interacting DM, the isothermal core of the halo can act as a reservoir for the energy liberated from the SMBH orbits. A realistic velocity dependence, such as generated by the exchange of a massive mediator like a dark photon, is favored to give a good fit to the GW spectrum while providing a large enough core. A similar velocity dependence has been advocated for solving the small-scale structure problems of cold DM. ",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14450,-1

The unitarized chiral perturbation approach is then applied as the underlying theory to predict the energy levels of these systems in a finite volume. These energy levels are well described by the $K$-matrix parameterization constrained by flavor SU(3) symmetry. With the parameters from the best fits, the poles extracted from the $K$-matrix parameterization closely correspond to those derived from the underlying chiral effective field theory, as long as they are close to physical region and not significantly higher than the lowest relevant threshold.

We compare and contrast general features of our methodology with other common practices and emphasize the improvements derived from our approach that we view as essential for applications where extracting details of nonperturbative transverse hadron structure is a major goal. These include the HSO's preservation of a basic TMD parton-model-like framework even while accounting for full TMD factorization and evolution, explicit preservation of the integral relationship between TMD and collinear pdfs, and the ability to meaningfully compare different theoretical models of nonperturbative TMD parton distributions. In our examples, we show that there is significant sensitivity at moderate $Q^2$ to both the form of the nonperturbative transverse momentum dependence and the parametrization of collinear parton densities. However, we also find that evolving to $Q^2 = M_Z^2$, without fitting, results in a satisfactory postdiction of existing data for $Z^0$ production, nearly independently of the modeling of nonperturbative transverse momentum behavior. We argue that this demonstrates that moderate $Q$ measurements should be given greater weight than high $Q$ measurements in extractions of nonperturbative transverse momentum dependence.

In this work we perform a detailed statistical analysis of the signal in order to elucidate its physical origin. Specifically, we test the standard explanation in terms of supermassive black hole mergers against the prominent alternative explanation in terms of a first-order phase transition. By means of a frequentist hypothesis test we find that the observed gravitational wave spectrum prefers a first-order phase transition at $2-3\sigma$ significance compared to black hole mergers (depending on the underlying black hole model). This mild preference is linked to the relatively large amplitude of the observed gravitational wave signal (above the typical expectation of black hole models) and to its spectral shape (which slightly favors the phase-transition spectrum over the predominantly single power-law spectrum predicted in black hole models). The best fit to the combined PTA data set is obtained for a phase transition which dominantly produces the gravitational wave signal by bubble collisions (rather than by sound waves). The best-fit (energy-density) spectrum features, within the frequency band of the PTA experiments, a crossover from a steeply rising power law (causality tail) to a softly rising power law; the peak frequency then falls slightly above the PTA-measured range. Such a spectrum can be obtained for a strong first-order phase transition in the thick-wall regime of vacuum tunneling which reheats the Universe to a temperature of $T_*\sim \text{GeV}$. A dark sector phase transition at the GeV-scale provides a comparably good fit. ",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13729,0

The magnitude of these effects points to natal kicks that originate from asymmetries during the supernova (SN) explosions. Using a growing set of long-time 3D SN simulations with the Prometheus-Vertex code, we explore the interplay of NS kicks that are induced by asymmetric neutrino emission and by asymmetric mass ejection. Anisotropic neutrino emission can arise from a large-amplitude dipolar convection asymmetry inside the proto-NS (PNS) termed LESA (Lepton-number Emission Self-sustained Asymmetry), which determines the kicks of NSs born from stars near the low-mass end of SN progenitors. In more massive progenitors aspherical accretion downflows around the PNS can also lead to anisotropic neutrino emission (absorption) with a neutrino-induced NS kick roughly opposite to (aligned with) the kick by asymmetric mass ejection. We estimate upper bounds for the final neutrino kicks of 150-260 km/s, whereas the hydrodynamic kicks can reach up to more than 1300 km/s. Therefore the hydrodynamic kicks dominate for NSs from explosions of higher-mass progenitors, whereas the neutrino kicks dominate in the case of NSs from the lowest-mass progenitors. Our models suggest that the Crab pulsar as a representative of the latter category could have received its velocity of about 160 km/s by a neutrino kick due to the LESA asymmetry. Such neutrino kicks of 100-200 km/s define a nearly ubiquitous floor value, which may shed new light on the origin of pulsars in globular clusters. Black holes, if formed by the collapse of short-lived PNSs and solely kicked by anisotropic neutrino emission, obtain velocities of only some km/s. ",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13817,0

The ordinary Gaussian model is superintegrable, i.e. the average of the Schur functions $S_Q$ is an explicit function of the Young diagram $Q$. The question is what happens to this property after perturbation. We show that the entire perturbation series can be nicely summed up into a kind of Borel transform of a universal exponential function, while the dependence on $R$ enters through a polynomial factor in front of this exponential. Moreover, these polynomials can be described explicitly through a single additional structure, which we call ``truncation'' of the Young diagram $Q$. It is unclear if one can call this an extended superintegrability, but at least it is a tremendously simple deformation of it. Moreover, the vanishing Gaussian correlators remain vanishing and, hence, are not deformed at all. ",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14392,0

An analog known as the ergodic bipartition (EB) describes entanglement and locality and is formulated in terms of the components of eigenstates. In this paper, we significantly generalize the EB and unify it with the ETH, extending the EB to study higher correlations and systems out of equilibrium. Our main result is a diagrammatic formalism that computes arbitrary correlations between eigenstates and operators based on a recently uncovered connection between the ETH and free probability theory. We refer to the connected components of our diagrams as generalized free cumulants. We apply our formalism in several ways. First, we focus on chaotic eigenstates and establish the so-called subsystem ETH and the Page curve as consequences of our construction. We also improve known calculations for thermal reduced density matrices and comment on an inherently free probabilistic aspect of the replica approach to entanglement entropy previously noticed in a calculation for the Page curve of an evaporating black hole. Next, we turn to chaotic quantum dynamics and demonstrate the ETH as a sufficient mechanism for thermalization, in general. In particular, we show that reduced density matrices relax to their equilibrium form and that systems obey the Page curve at late times. We also demonstrate that entanglement velocities, which govern the spreading of entanglement, are encoded in higher correlations of the EB. Lastly, we examine the chaotic structure of eigenstates and operators together and reveal previously overlooked correlations between them. Crucially, these correlations encode butterfly velocities, a well-known dynamical property of interacting quantum systems. ",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13829,0

Concretely, we extend the Standard Model (SM) with just two new particles, a Dirac fermion (the dark matter) and a real scalar, both charged under the $Z_6$ symmetry. After acquiring a vacuum expectation value, the scalar gives mass to the dark matter and mixes with the Higgs boson, providing the link between the dark sector and the SM particles.

We also consider the 10d uplift of AdS4 vacua arising from the 4d massive Type IIA effective theory with only RR and NSNS fluxes.

This is usually considered as an auxiliary regulator to be removed after computations by sending $V_o\to\infty$. In this paper, we analyse the dependence of the classical and quantum theory of homogeneous, isotropic and spatially flat cosmology on $V_o$. We show that each fixed $V_o$ regularisation leads to a different canonically independent theory. At the classical level, the dynamics of observables is not affected by the regularisation on-shell. For the quantum theory, however, this leads to a family of regulator dependent quantum representations and the limit $V_o\to\infty$ becomes then more subtle. First, we construct a novel isomorphism between different $V_o$-regularisations, which allows us to identify states in the different $V_o$-labelled Hilbert spaces to ensure equivalent dynamics for any value of $V_o$. The $V_o\to\infty$ limit would then correspond to choosing a state for which the volume assigned to the fiducial cell becomes infinite as appropriate in the late-time regime. As second main result of our analysis, quantum fluctuations of observables smeared over subregions $V\subset V_o$, unlike those smeared over the full $V_o$, explicitly depend on the size of the fiducial cell through the ratio $V/V_o$ interpreted as the (inverse) number of subcells $V$ homogeneously patched together into $V_o$. Physically relevant fluctuations for a finite region, as e.g. in the early-time regime, which would be unreasonably suppressed in a na\""ive $V_o\to\infty$ limit, become appreciable at small volumes. Our results suggest that the fiducial cell is not playing the role of a mere regularisation but is physically relevant at the quantum level and complement previous statements in the literature.

Motivated by the ubiquity of anti-de Sitter vacua in string theory, we consider a string-inspired scenario where the DE sector consists of a negative cosmological constant (nCC) and a evolving component with positive energy density on top, whose equation of state is allowed to cross the phantom divide. We show that such a scenario can drastically alter the growth of structure compared to $\Lambda$CDM, and accommodate the otherwise puzzling JWST observations if the dynamical component evolves from the quintessence-like regime in the past to the phantom regime today: in particular, we demonstrate that the presence of a nCC (which requires a higher density for the evolving component) plays a crucial role in enhancing the predicted cumulative comoving stellar mass density.

To extract large quantities of energy one needs to mount a recursive Penrose process where particles are confined and can bounce back to suffer ever again a decaying process in the black hole electric ergoregion. In an asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, two situations of confinement are possible. One situation uses a reflecting mirror at some radius, which obliges the energetic outgoing particles to return to the decaying point. The other situation uses the natural AdS property that sends back at some intrinsic returning radius those outgoing energetic particles. In addition, besides the conservation laws the decaying process must obey, one has to set conditions at the decaying point for the particles debris. These conditions restrain the possible scenarios, but there are still a great number of available scenarios for the decays. Within these, we choose two scenarios, scenario 1 and scenario 2, that pertain to the masses and electric charges of the final particles. Thus, in the mirror situation we find that scenario 1 leads to a black hole energy factory, and scenario 2 ends in a black hole bomb. In the no mirror situation, i.e., pure Reissner-Nordstr\""om-AdS, scenario 1 leads again to a black hole energy factory, but scenario 2 yields no bomb. This happens because the volume in which the particles are confined increases to infinity along the chain of decays, leading to a zero value of the extracted energy per unit volume and the bomb is demined. The whole treatment performed here involves no backreaction on the black hole mass and electric charge, nevertheless we speculate that the end state of the recursive process is a Reissner-Nordstr\""om-AdS black hole with very short hair, i.e., with one particle at rest at some definite radius.

Considering the exact solution of the magnetized Kerr spacetime, here we derive the exact expression of efficiency ($\eta_{\rm MPP}$) for MPP, which is valid for both the Kerr black hole (BH) as well as Kerr superspinar (SS), and also from the weak magnetic field to an ultra-strong magnetic field $(B)$ which can even distort the original Kerr geometry. We show that although the value of $\eta_{\rm MPP}$ increases upto a certain value of ultra-strong magnetic field ($B_p$), it decreases to zero for $B > B_p$, in case of the Kerr BHs. One intriguing feature that emerges is, $\eta_{\rm MPP}$ acquires the maximum value for the Kerr parameter $a_* \approx 0.786$ (unlike $a_*=1$ for the ordinary PP), decreases for the range $0.786 < a_* \leq 1$, and reaches to $20.7\%$ for $a_*=1$ with a few limitations. This indicates that the BH starts to expel the effect of magnetic field for $a_* > 0.786$, and is fully expelled from the extremal Kerr BH due to the gravitational Meissner effect. As a special case of MPP, we also study the ordinary Penrose process (PP) for the magnetized Kerr spacetime. We show that the efficiency of PP decreases with increasing the magnetic field for the Kerr BH. In fact, the MPP for Kerr BHs, Kerr SSs and the ordinary PP for Kerr SSs can be superefficient for the astrophysical applications to powering engines in the high-energy sources like active galactic nuclei and quasars, in the weak magnetic fields. It is almost impossible to extract the energy from a BH (SS) through MPP (PP) in the ultra-strong magnetic fields. ",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13347,0

For the alignments on the same side of the string, we find that the presence of a cosmic string may either assist or inhibit entanglement harvesting both in the sense of the entanglement harvested and the harvesting-achievable range of interdetector separation depending on the detector-to-string distance, and this is remarkably different from the case of a locally flat spacetime with a reflecting boundary where the boundary always enlarges the harvesting-achievable range. For the alignment with detectors on two different sides of the string, the detectors notably can always harvest more entanglement than those in flat spacetime without a cosmic string, which is in sharp contrast to those on the same side. Interestingly, the presence of a cosmic string enlarges the harvesting-achievable range for the detectors in vertical alignment only in the vicinity of the string, while it always reduces the harvesting-achievable range for the detectors in parallel alignment.

Smaller $\gamma$ implies more chaotic dynamics. The chaos bound is given by $\gamma=\beta/4$ where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature. We give analytical argument in support of this proposal. The slower exponential fall also means that the action of the operator on a state leads to higher delocalization in energy eigenbasis.

The near cosmic coincidence is then explained by an approximate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ exchange symmetry between the two sectors, where dark matter consists of stable dark neutrons, with matter and dark matter asymmetries arising via parallel WIMP baryogenesis mechanisms. Taking a top-down perspective, we point out that an adequate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry necessitates solving the electroweak hierarchy problem in each sector, without our committing to a specific implementation. A higher-dimensional realization in the far UV is presented, in which the hierarchical couplings of the two sectors and the requisite $\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking structure arise naturally from extra-dimensional localization and gauge symmetries. We trace the cosmic history, paying attention to potential pitfalls not fully considered in previous literature. Residual $\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking can very plausibly give rise to the asymmetric reheating of the two sectors, needed to keep the cosmological abundance of relativistic dark particles below tight bounds. We show that, despite the need to keep inter-sector couplings highly suppressed after asymmetric reheating, there can naturally be order-one couplings mediated by TeV scale particles which can allow experimental probes of the dark sector at high energy colliders.

In particular, a tiny sub-component of dark matter that interacts strongly with the visible sector may cool the gas in the intergalactic medium and significantly alter the expected absorption signal at Cosmic Dawn. However, the information about new physics in this observable is obscured by astrophysical systematic uncertainties. In the absence of a microscopic framework describing the astrophysical sources, these uncertainties can be encoded in a bottom up effective theory for the 21-cm observables in terms of unconstrained astrophysical fluxes. In this paper, we take a first step towards a careful assessment of the degeneracies between new physics effects and the uncertainties in these fluxes. We show that the latter can be constrained by combining measurements of the UV luminosity function, the Planck measurement of the CMB optical depth to reionization, and an upper bound on the unresolved X-ray flux. Leveraging those constraints, we demonstrate how new physics signatures can be disentangled from astrophysical effects. Focusing on the case of millicharged dark matter, we find sharp predictions, with small uncertainties within the viable parameter space. ",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10978,-1

In this work, we study the properties of the pion and kaon, such as mass, condensate, and leptonic decay constant, for various $N_f$ and $N_c$. We use the symmetry-preserving vector-vector flavor-dependent contact interaction model of quark. The dynamical quark masses are calculated by using the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE). The masses of the pion and kaon for different values of $N_f$ and $N_c$ are determined using the homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation. For fixed $N_f=2$ and $N_c$ is increased, the dynamically generated quark mass ( mass of up and down quarks), strange quark mass, meson in-condensate, and decay constant, all increases. The pion mass remains approximately constant until $N_c$ reaches around 6.5, after which it grows rapidly. On the other hand, the kaon mass increases slowly with increasing $N_c$ until it reaches approximately $N_c=7.5$, beyond which it rises quickly. When $N_c=3$ is fixed at and various values of $N_f$ are considered, all the parameter values decrease as a function of $N_f$, except for the pion and kaon mass, which increase above a critical value of $N_f$ around $8$. This is the region where chiral symmetry is restored, and the pion and kaon behave as free particles, similar to their behavior in the presence of a heat bath.

It is shown via lattice simulations how the relic density of axion-like particles with masses close to the one of the QCD axion is affected by axion-gauge field interactions and by initial axion inhomogeneities. For pre-inflationary axions, once the Hubble parameter becomes smaller than the axion mass, the latter starts to oscillate, and part of its energy density is spent producing gauge fields via parametric resonance. If the gauge fields are dark photons and Standard Model photons, the energy density of dark photons becomes higher than the one of the axion, while the high conductivity of the primordial plasma damps the oscillations of the photon field. Such a scenario allows for the production of small-scale, primordial magnetic fields, and it is found that the relic density of axions with a low decay constant are within the bounds set by the $\Lambda$CDM model, while GUT-scale axions are far too abundant. It is also shown that initial inhomogeneities of the axion field can change substantially the gauge field production, boosting or suppressing (depending on the axion parameters and couplings) the magnetogenesis mechanism with respect to an homogeneous axion field.

Indeed, this object is one of the ingredients needed for the construction of any variable flavour number (factorization) scheme at O(alphas^3). The construction of such scheme is crucial for the improvement of the accuracy of the extraction of the parton distribution functions from the experimental data, that in turn will provide an improvement of the accuracy of all the theoretical predictions in high energy physics.   Despite the function we are interested in is not known exactly, its expansion in some kinematic limits is available. In particular the high-scale limit (Q^2 >> m^2), high-energy limit (z->0, where z is the argument of the coefficient function) and threshold limit (z->zmax=1/(1+4m^2/Q^2)) of the exact coefficient function are all known, with the exception of some terms that we will provide in approximate form. Therefore, combining these limits in a proper way, we will construct an approximation for the unknown term of the N^3LO gluon coefficient function, that describes the exact curve in the whole range of z.   Since other approximations for the N^3LO gluon coefficient functions are present in the literature, we will conclude by comparing our final approximate coefficient functions with such approximations. We will show a comparison both for the NNLO, whose exact function is known, and for the N^3LO. With our approach, we expect our results to be more accurate than previous approximations, thus providing a sufficient precision for a complete description of DIS at N^3LO and the consequent determination of N^3LO PDFs.

Here we consider a scalar field that is temporarily unstable by virtue of a transient tachyonic mass, and we construct models in which it is embedded consistently within inflation. Assuming IR-finite couplings between the tachyon and the inflaton, we find an exchange bispectrum with an enhanced long-short scale coupling that grows in the squeezed limit parametrically faster than local non-Gaussianity. Our approximately scale-invariant signal can be thought of as a cosmological tachyon collider.

The pair production via the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process in such a high-energy environment eliminates part of the $\gamma$-photons in the outgoing $\gamma$-beam, increasing the statistical error and decreasing the accuracy of this VP signal. In contrast, we investigate the conversion of the emerging circular polarization of $\gamma$-photons into longitudinal polarization of the created positrons, considering the latter as the main VP signal. To study the VP effects in the highly nonlinear regime, where the Euler-Heisenberg effective Lagrangian method breaks down, we have developed a Monte-Carlo simulation method, incorporating vacuum birefringence and dichroism via the one-loop QED probabilities in the locally constant field approximation. Our Monte Carlo method will enable the study of VP effects in strong fields of arbitrary configuration. With 10~PW laser systems, we demonstrate the feasibility of detecting the fermionic signal of the VP effect at the 5$\sigma$ confidence level with a few hours of measurement time.

Imposing conformal boundary conditions for static interfaces implies energy conservation at the interface. Recently, the reflective and transmitive properties of such static conformal interfaces have been studied in two dimensions by scattering matter at the interface impurity. In this note, we generalize this to the case of dynamic interfaces. Motivated by the connections between the moving mirror and the black hole, we choose a particular profile for the dynamical interface. We show that a part of the total energy of each side will be lost in the interface. In other words, a time-dependent interface can accumulate or absorb energy. While, in general, the interface follows a time-like trajectory, one can take a particular limit of a profile parameter($\beta$), such that the interface approaches a null line asymptotically$(\beta\rightarrow 0)$. In this limit, we show that for a class of boundary conditions, the interface behaves like a `semipermeable membrane'. We also consider another set of conformal boundary conditions for which, in the null line limit, the interface mimics the properties expected of a horizon. In this case, we devise a scattering experiment, where (zero-point subtracted) energy from one CFT is fully transmitted to the other CFT, while from the other CFT, energy can neither be transmitted nor reflected, i.e., it gets lost in the interface. This boundary condition is also responsible for the thermal energy spectrum which mimics Hawking radiation. This is analogous to the black hole where the horizon plays the role of a one-sided `membrane', which accumulates all the interior degrees of freedom and radiates thermally in the presence of quantum fluctuation. Stimulated by this observation, we comment on some plausible construction of wormhole analogues. ",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11451,0

One can ask the same question about unitarity of quantum and inflationary cosmology. In this paper we argue that in both cases, for black holes and for cosmology, the answer is negative and we face non-unitarity.   Such a question can not be addressed by using the fixed classical gravitational background since one has to take into account the backreaction. To his end one uses the semi-classical gravity, which includes the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor operator of the matter fields. One has to renormalize the energy-momentum tensor and one gets an effective action which contains quadratic terms in scalar curvature and Ricci tensor. Such quadratic gravity contains ghosts which in fact lead to violation of unitarity in black holes and cosmology. We discuss the question whether black holes will emit ghosts.   One can try to restrict ourselves to the $f(R)$ gravity that seems is a good approximation to the semi-classical gravity and widely used in cosmology. The black hole entropy in $f(R)$ gravity is different from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and from entanglement island entropy. The black hole entropy in $R+R^2$ gravity goes to a constant during the evaporation process. This can be interpreted as another indication to the possible non-unitarity in black holes and cosmology ",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12191,0

We first apply an iterative solver to determine the quark propagator on the spacelike real axis.

In order to compute of these integrals, we apply customized variable transformations for the radial integral after subtracting the asymptotics.

The masses are beyond the Hawking (black hole) evaporation limit of $10^{15}$ g, so that those primordial black holes may be viewed as viable candidates for part or the whole of the current dark matter. The parameters of the superpotential were fine-tuned for those purposes, while the cubic term in the superpotential is essential whereas the quadratic term should vanish.

The non-Hermiticity thus results in the failure of the familiar notions of bulk-boundary correspondence found for Hermitian systems. This necessitates the search for topological invariants which can characterize gap-closings in open non-Hermitian systems correctly and unambiguously.
