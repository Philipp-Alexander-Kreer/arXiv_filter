In this work, octet baryon axial form factors are calculated using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector $\times$ vector contact interaction (SCI). The baryons are considered as quark-plus-interacting-diquark bound states, whose structure (wave function) is obtained by solving a Poincar\'e-covariant Faddeev equation. Since it preserves symmetries, all consequences of partial conservation of the axial current are manifest. For instance, one finds that octet baryon axial properties are consistent with only minor violations of SU(3)-flavour symmetry, being interpreted as a dynamical consequence of emergent hadron mass (EHM). Considering neutral axial currents, the SCI delivers predictions for the flavour separation of octet baryon axial charges and, consequently, produces values for the associated SU(3) singlet, triplet, and octet axial charges. The results indicate that, at the hadron scale $\zeta_{\mathcal{H}}$, valence degrees of freedom carry approximately $50\%$ of an octet baryon's total spin. Proton structure is one of the principal topics in hadron physics. Its study is expected to reveal key features of both the origin of mass and strong interaction dynamics. This work therefore extended the above analyses to an examination of in-proton parton helicity (spin) distribution functions (DFs). Using Ans\""atze for hadron-scale proton polarised valence quark DFs, predictions are delivered for all proton polarised DFs at the measurement scale $\zeta_{\rm C}^2 = 3\,$GeV$^2$. The pointwise behaviour of the predicted DFs and, consequently, their moments, shows good agreement with results inferred from data. Based on these results, one finds that experimental measurements of the proton flavour-singlet axial charge should return a value $a_0^{\rm E}(\zeta_{\rm C}) = 0.35(2)$.

K. Rajouria ", hep-ph ," 17 pages, 4 figures, accepted in Advances in High Energy Physics ",NA,NA,NA,"   The phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and its associated thermodynamic properties of quark gluon plasma (QGP) are studied in the presence of time dependent magnetic field. The study plays a pivotal role in the field of cosmology, astrophysics, and heavy ion collisions. In order to explore the structure of quark gluon plasma to deal with the dynamics of quarks and gluons, we investigate the equation of state (EoS) not only in the environment of static magnetic field but also in the presence of time-varying magnetic fields. So, for determining the equation of state of QGP at non zero magnetic fields, we revisited our earlier model where the effect of time varying magnetic field was not taken into consideration. Using the phenomenological model, some appealing features are noticed depending upon the three different scales; effective mass of quark, temperature, and time independent as well as time-dependent magnetic field. Earlier the effective mass of quark was incorporated in our calculations and in the current work, it is modified for static and time-varying magnetic fields. Thermodynamic observables including pressure, energy density, entropy, etc. are calculated for a wide range of temperature and time- dependent as well as time-independent magnetic fields. Finally, we claim that the EoS are highly affected in the presence of a magnetic field. Our results are notable compared to other approaches and found to be advantageous for the measurement of QGP equation of state. These crucial findings with and without time-varying magnetic field could have phenomenological implications in various sectors of high energy physics. ",https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02176,0

Accepted by Chinese Physics C ",NA,NA, 10.1088/1674-1137/ad243e ,"   In this paper, we reanalyze the top-quark pair production at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD at future $e^+e^-$ colliders by using the Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC) method. The PMC renormalization scales in $\alpha_s$ are determined by absorbing the non-conformal $\beta$ terms by recursively using the Renormalization Group Equation (RGE). Unlike the conventional scale-setting method of fixing the scale at the center-of-mass energy $\mu_r=\sqrt{s}$, the determined PMC scale $Q_\star$ is far smaller than the $\sqrt{s}$ and increases with the $\sqrt{s}$, yielding the correct physical behavior for the top-quark pair production process. Moreover, the convergence of the pQCD series for the top-quark pair production is greatly improved due to the elimination of the renormalon divergence. For a typical collision energy of $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV, the PMC scale is $Q_\star=107$ GeV; the QCD correction factor $K$ for conventional results is $K\sim1+0.1244^{+0.0102+0.0012}_{-0.0087-0.0011}+0.0184^{-0.0086+0.0002}_{+0.0061-0.0003}$, where the first error is caused by varying the scale $\mu_r\in[\sqrt{s}/2, 2\sqrt{s}]$ and the second error is from the top-quark mass $\Delta{m_t}=\pm0.7$ GeV. After applying the PMC, the renormalization scale uncertainty is eliminated and the QCD correction factor $K$ is improved to $K\sim 1+0.1507^{+0.0015}_{-0.0015}-0.0057^{+0.0001}_{-0.0000}$, where the error is from the top-quark mass $\Delta{m_t}=\pm0.7$ GeV.

Uma Sankar ", hep-ph hep-ex , 31 pages ,NA,NA,NA,"   With the advent of Belle II and the LHCb upgrade, the precision measurements of various B-Physics observables are on cards. This holds significant potential for delving into physics beyond the standard model of electroweak interactions. These measurements can also serve as means to establish limits on phenomena occurring at much finer length scales, such as quantum decoherence, which may arise due to potential discreteness in space-time or non-trivial topological effects. In this work, we set up the formalism to investigate the impact of quantum decoherence on several potential observables in $B$ meson systems. The approach employs the trace-preserving Kraus operator formalism, extending unitary evolution to non-unitary dynamics while maintaining complete positivity. In this formalism, the decoherence effects are parametrized in terms of a single parameter. Through the analysis of purely leptonic, semileptonic, and non-leptonic decays of $B$ mesons, we identify observables that could, in principle, be influenced by decoherence. The theoretical expressions are provided without neglecting the impact of decay width difference ($\Delta \Gamma$) and $CP$ violation in mixing. Considering that many of these observables can be measured with high precision using the abundant data collected by LHCb and Belle II, our formalism can be applied to establish constraints on the decoherence parameter through multiple decay channels. This offers an alternative set-up for such studies, which, at present, are predominantly conducted in the neutrino sector. ",https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02470,0

Furthermore, various showering modules within these event generators are explored for $Z$ + 1-jet production. While the three of these MC frameworks reproduce the $Z$ + 1-jet kinematics similarly, certain discrepancies in their predictions are identified in some variables.

The current experimental data, including the $\eta$ polar angular distribution, cannot distinguish which $K^*\bar K_1(1270)$ bound state contributes to the $J/\psi\to\phi\eta\eta'$ process, or if both are involved. Therefore, we propose further explorations of this process, as well as other processes, in upcoming experiments with many more $J/\psi$ events to disentangle the different possibilities.

It was discovered that the asymmetry bifurcates into two states with positive and negative asymmetry for the inverse hierarchy of neutrino masses. A state with a normal hierarchy of neutrino masses is unstable and is not realized. It is shown that the maximum CP violation is realized. The influence of this process on the dispersion of the primordial $^4\text{He}$ mass fraction is calculated, which is confirmed by astrophysical observations.

However, so far, there not only exists sizable tension in the parameters of those states, but there is also no consensus on the number of the vector states in this energy range. To some extend, this might be caused by the fact that the experimental data were typically analyzed in single channel analyses employing overlapping Breit-Wigner functions, in particular ignoring the effect of opening thresholds. In this study, we focus on the mass range between $4.2$ and $4.35$ GeV, conducting a comprehensive analysis of eight different final states in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation. Our findings demonstrate that, within this mass range, a single vector charmonium-like state, exhibiting properties consistent with a $D_1\bar D$ molecular structure and characterized by a pole location $\sqrt{s_\text{pole}^{Y(4230)}}=\left( 4227{\pm} 3 {-} \frac{i}{2}(50^{+10}_{-5}) \right) \text{MeV}$, can effectively describe all the collected data. This is made possible by allowing for an interference with the well-established vector chamonium $\psi(4160)$ along with the inclusion of the $D_1\bar D$ threshold effect. Moreover, in contrast to experimental analyses, our study reveals that the highly asymmetric total cross sections for $e^+e^-\to J/\psi\pi\pi$ and $e^+e^-\to J/\psi K\bar K$ around 4230 MeV stem from the same physics, rooted in the approximate SU(3) flavor symmetry of QCD.

For a dimensionless string tension parameter $G\mu \approx 10^{-9} - 10^{-5}$, the monopoles are superheavy with masses of order $10^{15} - 10^{17}$ GeV.

The study finds application in anomalous transport, whenever chirally unbalanced matter is present, with propagating external currents that are classically conserved. Examples are topological materials and the chiral magnetic effect in the plasma state of matter of the early universe. We classify the minimal number of form factors of the $AVV$ parameterization, by a complete analysis of the Schouten identities in the presence of a heat bath. We show that the longitudinal (anomaly) sector in the axial-vector channel, for on-shell and off-shell photons, is protected against corrections coming from the insertion of a chemical potential in the fermion loop. When the photons are on-shell, we prove that also the transverse sector, in the same channel, is $\mu$-independent and vanishes. The related effective action is shown to be always described by the exchange of a massless anomaly pole, as in the case of vanishing chemical potentials. The pole is interpreted as an interpolating axion-like quasiparticle generated by the anomaly. In each axial-vector channel, it is predicted to be a correlated fermion/antifermion pseudoscalar (axion-like) quasiparticle appearing in the response function, once the material is subjected to an external chiral perturbation. The cancellation of the $\mu$ dependence extends to any chiral current within the Standard Model, including examples like $B$ (baryon), $L$ (lepton), and $B-L$.

A QGP could exist in the early stages of the Universe, and in various objects and events in the cosmos. The thermodynamic and hydrodynamic properties of the QGP are described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and can be studied in heavy-ion collisions. Despite being a key thermodynamic parameter, the QGP temperature is still poorly known. Thermal lepton pairs ($e^+e^-$ and $\mu^+\mu^-$) are ideal penetrating probes of the true temperature of the emitting source, since their invariant-mass spectra suffer neither from strong final-state interactions nor from blue-shift effects due to rapid expansion. Here we measure the QGP temperature using thermal $e^+e^-$ production at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The average temperature from the low-mass region (in-medium $\rho^0$ vector-meson dominant) is $(1.99 \pm 0.24) \times 10^{12}$ K, consistent with the chemical freeze-out temperature from statistical models and the phase transition temperature from LQCD. The average temperature from the intermediate mass region (above the $\rho^0$ mass, QGP dominant) is significantly higher at $(3.40 \pm 0.55)\times 10^{12}$ K.

The note emphasizes, in  general terms, the importance of rigorous nonflow estimation before comparing  experimental anisotropy measurements to theoretical hydrodynamic calculations  to extract quantitative physics ",NA,NA,NA,"   Hydrodynamics can describe majority of the measured azimuthal anisotropies in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Many of the anisotropy measurements are contaminated by nonflow correlations (i.e., those unrelated to global event-wise correlations). Those nonflow contamination can cause incorrectness or compromise the accuracy of the physics extracted from data-hydrodynamics comparison, particularly when one relies on subtle difference in the measurements. In the recent preprint by STAR (arXiv:2401.06625) extracting the Uranium nucleus deformation parameter, nonflow contamination is assessed by subevents in the limited STAR acceptance. In this note, we demonstrate that such assessment is inadequate and illustrate how large an effect nonflow can cause by using the HIJING model, in which all correlations are nonflow and non-hydrodynamic. We thereby conclude that the extracted Uranium deformation parameter is premature and emphasize the importance of an earnest assessment of or correction for nonflow contamination, not only for this STAR analysis but more generally for studies relying on comparing anisotropy measurements to hydrodynamic calculations.

Comments welcome ",NA,NA,NA,"   Observables in quantum gravity are famously defined asymptotically, at the boundary of AdS or Minkowski spaces. However, by gauge fixing a coordinate system or suitably dressing the field operators, an approximate, ""quasi-local"" approach is also possible, that can give account of the measurements performed by a set of observers living inside the spacetime. In particular, one can attach spatial coordinates to the worldlines of these observers and use their proper times as a time coordinate. Here we highlight that any such local formulation has to face the relativity of the event, in that changing frame (= set of observers) implies a reshuffling of the point-events and the way they are identified. As a consequence, coordinate transformations between different frames become probabilistic in quantum gravity. We give a concrete realization of this mechanism in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, where a point in the bulk can be defined operationally with geodesics anchored to the boundary. We describe different ways to do so, each corresponding to a different frame, and compute the variances of the transformations relating some of these frames. In particular, we compute the variance of the location of the black hole horizon, which appears smeared in most frames. We then suggest how to calculate this effect in Einstein gravity, assuming knowledge of the wavefunction of the metric. The idea is to expand the latter on a basis of semiclassical states. Each element of this basis enjoys standard/deterministic coordinate transformations and the result is thus obtained by superposition. As a divertissement, we sabotage the familiar Lorentz boosts by adding to Minkoswki spacetime a quantum superposition of gravitational waves and compute the probabilistic transformation to a boosted frame in linearized gravity. Finally, we attempt to translate the relativity of the event in the language of dressed operators. ",https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01847,0

If we present a knot as the closure of a braid, then it is known that for braids of width two and three, such knots do not exist. The question for four-strand braids is already open. S. Bigelow showed in 2000 that if the Burau representation for four-strand braids is unfaithful, then there is an infinite number of non-trivial knots with the trivial two-variable HOMFLY-PT polynomial and hence, with the trivial Jones polynomial, since it is obtained from the HOMFLY-PT polynomial by the specialisation of one of the variables $A=q^2$.

Another confirmation is checking whether there exist consistent HOMFLY-PT polynomials of related knots. We have also tried a straightforward search for knots with the obtained HOMFLY-PT polynomials.

Our formula works for quenches producing entangled multiplets of an arbitrary number of excitations. We benchmark our results in the $XX$ spin chain. First, by using an elementary approach based on the multidimensional stationary phase approximation we provide an $\textit{ab initio}$ rigorous derivation of the dynamics of the charged moments for the quench treated in [2]. Then, we show that the same results can be straightforwardly obtained within our quasiparticle picture. As a byproduct of our analysis, we obtain a general criterion ensuring a vanishing entanglement asymmetry at long times. Next, by using the Lindblad master equation, we study the effect of gain and loss dissipation on the entanglement asymmetry. Specifically, we investigate the fate of the so-called quantum Mpemba effect (QME) in the presence of dissipation. We show that dissipation can induce QME even if unitary dynamics that does not show it, and we provide a quasiparticle-based interpretation of the condition for the QME.

The clock is chosen in such a way that the shear of the null boundary follows the profile of a step function. The angular dependence is arbitrary. Next, we solve the residual constraints, which are the Raychaudhuri equation and a Carrollian transport equation for an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ holonomy. We show that the resulting submanifold in phase space is symplectic. Along each null generator, we end up with a simple mechanical system. The quantization of this system is straightforward. Our basic strategy is to start from an auxiliary Hilbert space with constraints. The physical Hilbert space is the kernel of a constraint, which is a combination of ladder operators. The constraint and its hermitian conjugate are second-class. Solving the constraint amounts to imposing a simple recursion relation for physical states. On the resulting physical Hilbert space, the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ Casimir is a Dirac observable. This observable determines the spectrum of the two radiative modes.

We investigate the geodesic structure, shadow, and optical appearance of such a black hole. Through analysis on the effective potential and the epicyclic frequencies, it is found that the existence of innermost/outermost stable circular orbits for a timelike particle is governed by the CDF parameters. The behaviors of the orbital conserved quantities and Keplerian frequency are also examined. Due to the existence of pseudo-cosmological horizon, the determination of the shadow radius depends significantly on the position of the observer. Viewing the CDF as driving cosmic expansion and placing the static observer far from both event and cosmological horizons, the CDF parameters are constrained by EHT observations. We investigate the effect of CDF on the shadows and optical images of the black hole, surrounded by various profiles of accretions. For the thin disk accretion, the light trajectories are categorized into direct emission, lensing ring, and photon ring based on impact parameters. Due to the existence of outermost stable circular orbits, outer edges could exist in the direct and lensing ring images. The observed brightness is mainly due to direct emission, with a minor contribution from the lensing ring, while the contribution from the photon ring is negligible due to extreme demagnetization. In the case of spherical accretion, we consider both static and infalling accretion models. The images obtained under infalling accretion are slightly darker than those under static accretion, attributed to the Doppler effect. Throughout the study, we analyze the influence of the parameters $B$ and $q$ on the results. ",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18066,0

Consequently, it enables us to delve into an in-depth anatomy of proton decay modes and anticipate future signatures. Our findings dictate that observing a proton decay into $p\to\pi^0e^+$ indicates gauge boson mediation, with the potential for observation of $p\to\eta^0e^+$ mode. Alternatively, if decay is through $p\to K^+\overline\nu$ process, it is mediated by a scalar leptoquark, possibly allowing the observation of $p\to\pi^0\mu^+$.

In this paper, we perform a dedicated analysis of the spectrum of axions radiated from strings based on large scale numerical simulations of the cosmological evolution of the Peccei-Quinn field on a static lattice. Making full use of the massively parallel code and computing resources, we executed the simulations with up to $11264^3$ lattice sites, which allows us to improve our understanding of the dependence on the parameter controlling the string tension and thus give a more accurate extrapolation of the numerical results. We found that there are several systematic effects that have been overlooked in previous works, such as the dependence on the initial conditions, contaminations due to oscillations in the spectrum, and discretisation effects, some of which could explain the discrepancy in the literature. We confirmed the trend that the spectral index of the axion emission spectrum increases with the string tension, but did not find a clear evidence of whether it continues to increase or saturates to a constant at larger values of the string tension due to the severe discretisation effects. Taking this uncertainty into account and performing the extrapolation with a simple power law assumption on the spectrum, we find that the dark matter mass is predicted in the range of $m_a \approx 95$-$450\,\mu\mathrm{eV}$.

Our result shows that shear viscosity tends to suppress both flow coefficients (${v_2\{2}\}$, ${v_2\{4\}}$, ${\langle v_2\rangle}$) and flow fluctuation (${\sigma_{v_2}}$) due to its smearing effect on local density fluctuation. The flow coefficients appear to be insensitive to the sub-nucleon structure, whereas for flow fluctuation ${\sigma_{v_2}}$, it tends to be suppressed by the sub-nucleon structure in central collisions but enhanced in peripheral collisions.

The constraint to the model is formulated by the condition $L_{\rm NB}\leq 3\times 10^{52}$ erg/s according to G. Raffelt with $L_{\rm NB}$ the luminosity of BSM neutral boson. Computing the above luminosity in the large coupling case, the so-called trapping regime, is non-trivial since the luminosity is a competition between the large production rate and the efficient absorption or decay rate of the neutral boson. We illustrate such a subtlety using $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model as an example where the $Z^{\prime}$ luminosity, $L_{Z^{\prime}}$, from the neutrinosphere is calculated.   We calculate $Z'$ production, absorption, and decay rates through pair-coalescence, semi-Compton, loop-bremsstrahlung from proton-neutron scattering, and their inverse processes in a benchmark SN simulation with muons.

We demonstrate that this plateau phenomenon can be understood by physical arguments and justified by numerical calculations.

We explore the implications of this special case of automorphic forms for physics beyond the standard model (BSM) within the lepton sector. In our model, we explicitly treat the Yukawa couplings as Siegel modular forms with both degree and level being equivalent to 2. We restrict our modulus parameter for $ \tau_{1}=\tau_{2} $ spanning within the finite modular $ S_{4}\times Z_{2} $ space.

We identified a generic issue in the standard procedure of computing the expansion history for models with time-dependent EoS, which leads to bias in the interpretation of the results. In order to compute the evolution of models with time-dependent EoS parameter $w$ in a consistent manner, we introduce an enhanced computational procedure, which accounts for the correct choice of initial conditions in the respective backward-in-time and forward-in-time evolution of the equations of motion. We implement our enhanced procedure in an amended version of the code CLASS, where we focus on exemplary DE models which are based on the CPL parameterization, studying cases with monotonically increasing and decreasing $w$ over cosmic time. Our results reveal that a cosmological DE model with a decreasing $w$ of the form $w(a)=-0.9 + 0.1(1-a)$ could provide a resolution to the Hubble tension problem. Moreover, we find characteristic signatures in the late expansion histories of models, allowing a phenomenological discrimination of DE candidates. Finally, we argue that our enhanced scheme should be implemented as a novel consistency check for cosmological models within current Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain (MCMC) methods. Our enhanced computational procedure avoids the interpretational bias to which the standard procedure is unwittingly exposed. As a result, DE models can be better constrained. If implemented into MCMC codes, we expect that our scheme will contribute to providing a significant improvement in the determined accuracy of cosmological model parameters.

For the vortex partition function in 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theory, we show that the wall-crossing formula agrees with the transformation formula by Halln\""as, Langmann, Noumi and Rosengren \cite{Halln_s_2022}. Since the $K$-theoretic vortex partition functions are related with indices such as the $\chi_t$-genus of the handsaw quiver variety, we discuss geometric interpretation of Euler transformations in terms of wall-crossing formulas of handsaw quiver variety.

Odintsov, and Vladimir Folomeev ", gr-qc astro-ph.SR hep-th ," 15 pages, 2 figure ",NA,NA,NA,"   We construct models of two exotic objects: (i) a wormhole whose throat is hidden by a stellar object like a neutron star; and (ii) a wormhole inside a black hole. We work within Einstein's gravity coupled to two scalar fields with a specific choice of the scalar field Lagrangian. In general, the model contains ghosts, but they are eliminated using the constraints given by the Lagrange multiplier fields. The constraints are a generalization of the mimetic constraint, where non-dynamical dark matter effectively appears. As a result, in our model, instead of the non-dynamical dark matter, non-dynamical exotic matter like a phantom effectively arises. For the mixed wormhole-plus-star system, we find the corresponding mass-radius relations and show that it is possible to get characteristics comparable to those of ordinary neutron stars. For the wormhole inside the black hole, we find an extremal limit where the radius of the throat coincides with the radius of the event horizon and demonstrate that the Hawking temperature vanishes in this limit.

If a system eventually reaches a thermal state in the long time limit, it's expected that its density matrix would resemble the mean-force Gibbs state. Moreover, the correlation function must satisfy the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition or equivalently the Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation (FDR). In this paper, we derive a formal expression for the non-Markovian two-point function within the context of the weak coupling limit. Using this expression, we explicitly compute the two-point function for specific models, demonstrating their adherence to the KMS. In addition, we have formulated a non-perturbative approach in the form of a self-consistent approximation that includes a partial resummation of perturbation theory. This approach can capture strong coupling phenomena while still relying on simple equations. Notably, we verify that the two-point function obtained through this method also satisfies the KMS condition. ",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16488,0

We base our investigation on static and spherically symmetric Morris-Thorne traversable wormholes, considering both constant and variable equation of state parameters. We derive the field equations and extract the shape function for each scenario. Moreover, we explore the gravitational decoupling technique and examine various forms of energy density for both a smeared and particle-like gravitational source, encompassing the realm of noncommutative geometry and a statically charged fluid. We also examinethe wormhole geometry through the utilization of embedding diagrams. Through our analysis, we uncover a violation of the Null Energy Condition (NEC).

Kelly ", quant-ph cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.stat-mech hep-th ," 16+4 pages, 11+5 figures ",NA,NA,NA,"   We study a random unitary circuit model of an impurity moving through a chaotic medium. By varying the velocity of the impurity, $v_d$, relative to the speed of information propagation within the medium, $v_B$, we control the exchange of information between the medium and impurity. Above supersonic velocities, $v_d> v_B$, information cannot flow back to the impurity after it has moved into the medium, and the resulting dynamics are Markovian. Below supersonic velocities, $v_d< v_B$, the dynamics of the impurity and medium are non-Markovian, and information is able to flow back onto the impurity. We show the two regimes are separated by a continuous phase transition with exponents directly related to the diffusive spreading of operators in the medium. This is demonstrated by monitoring an out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) in a scenario where the impurity is substituted at an intermediate time. During the Markovian phase, information from the medium cannot transfer onto the replaced impurity, manifesting in no significant operator development. Conversely, in the non-Markovian phase, we observe that operators acquire support on the newly introduced impurity. We also characterize the dynamics using the coherent information and provide two decoders which can efficiently probe the transition between Markovian and non-Markovian information flow. Our work demonstrates that Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics can be separated by a phase transition, and we propose an efficient protocol for observing this transition.

We apply the method to calculate infinite-temperature correlation functions for spin-$1/2$ systems on one- and two-dimensional lattices. In two dimensions the accessible timescale is large enough to essentially embrace the relaxation to equilibrium. The method allows one to accurately calculate transport coefficients.
